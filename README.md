# humeman/scriptlib
A simple asynchronous Python scripting library, designed to combine all
the tools you need to create effective shell scripts into one easy package.

Started in my cyberpatriot-scripts library, but I'm now splitting this off into
its own thing since I think it could be useful for a lot more than it is now.

## Roadmap
* [ ] Create base layout & classes
* [ ] Develop terminal
* [ ] Create async subprocess tools
* [ ] Port cyberpatriot-scripts as testing
* [ ] Create utils
